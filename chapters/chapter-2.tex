\section{The Standard Model}
\label{sec:SM}
The Standard Model of Physics (\acs{SM}) is currently the most successful formalism to describe the physical world at a microscopic scale.\\
The \acs{SM} provides descriptions for all currently known elementary particles and three out of four fundamental forces with the exception of gravity.\\
%- limitations: gravity \& general relativity, arbitrary free parameters
\subsection{Elementary particles}
Elementary particles in the \acs{SM} can be classified into two groups: bosons, consisting of particles following Bose-Einstein statistics with integer spin and fermions, consisting of particles following Fermi-Dirac statistics with half-integer spin\\
Fermions are the building blocks of composite particles and consequently all known matter, and can be further split into quarks \& leptons.\\
Bosons act as force mediators for all fundamental forces described by the \acs{SM}. Bosons have two types: a scalar boson with spin $0$ and vector gauge bosons with spin $1$.\\
For each elementary particle there also exists a corresponding antiparticle with identical mass and opposite charge (electric or color).

\subsubsection*{Fermions}
Quarks and leptons each has six flavors, grouped into three generations of doublets.\\
The six quark flavors consist of up ($u$), down ($d$), charm ($c$), strange ($s$), bottom ($b$) and top ($t$) quark flavors in increasing order of mass, forming three doublets $(u,d)$, $(c,s)$ and $(t,b)$.\\
Each doublet consists of one quark with electric charge of $+2/3$ ($u$, $s$, $t$), and one with charge of $-1/3$ ($d$, $c$, $b$).\\
Each quark also has a property known as color charge, with possible values of red ($R$), green ($G$), blue ($B$) or antired ($\bar{R}$), antigreen ($\bar{G}$), and antiblue ($\bar{B}$). Color charge follows color confinement rules, which allows only configurations of quarks with neutral color charge to exist in isolation. Neutral charge configurations can be formed from either a set of three colors $(R,G,B)$, a set of a color and its anticolor $(q,\bar{q})$, or any combination of the two. Consequently, no isolated quark can exist in a vacuum and can only exist in bound states called hadrons.\\
Quarks are the only elementary particles in the SM that can interact with all four fundamental forces.\\
The three leptons doublets consist of electron ($e$), muon ($\mu$), tau ($\tau$) and their respective neutrino flavors: electron neutrino ($\nu_e$), muon neutrino ($\nu_\mu$) and tau neutrino ($\nu_\tau$)\\
Charged leptons ($e$, $\mu$, $\tau$) carry an electric charge of $-1$, while their antiparticles carry the opposite charge $+1$ and their corresponding neutrino flavors carrying no charge (charge neutral).\\
Charged leptons interact with all fundamental forces except the strong force, while neutrinos only interact with the weak force and gravity.

\subsubsection*{Bosons}
The \acs{SM} classify bosons into two types: one scalar boson with spin $0$ known as the Higgs ($H$) boson, and vector gauge bosons with spin $1$ known as gluons ($g$), photon ($\gamma$), $W^\pm$ and $Z$ bosons.\\
The gluons and photon are massless, while the $W^\pm$, $Z$ and $H$ are massive.\\
Each vector gauge boson serves as the mediator for a fundamental force described by the SM.\\
Gluons are massless mediator particles for the strong interaction between quarks according to quantum chromodynamics (\acs{QCD}), and carry the color charge in a strong interaction. Each gluon carries a non-neutral color charge out of eight linearly independent color states in the gluon color octet.\\
Photon is the massless and charge-neutral mediator particle for the electromagnetic interaction following quantum electrodynamics (\acs{QED}).\\
The $W^\pm$ and $Z$ bosons are massive mediator particles for the weak interaction, with the $W^\pm$ boson carrying an electric charge of $\pm 1$ while the $Z$ boson is charge neutral.\\
Other than the vector gauge boson, the only scalar boson in the SM is the Higgs boson which is massive with electric charge of $0$.\\
The Higgs boson does not mediate a fundamental force like vector bosons, but serve to provide the rest mass for all massive elementary particles in the SM through the Higgs mechanism as described in Section \ref{eq:EW_L}ref{sec:higgs}.

\subsubsection*{Top quark}
\label{sec:top}
As of now, the top quark $t$ is the heaviest particle in the \acs{SM} with mass of about 173 GeV, compared to the heaviest fermion, the Higgs boson at 125 GeV and the second most massive fermion, the $b$-quark at about 4.2 GeV. This also gives it the strongest coupling to the Higgs boson and exotic resonances in various proposed \acs{BSM} models \textcolor{red}{(citations)}, making the top quark and its processes attractive vehicles with which to probe new physics.\\
Due to its mass, the top quark has a very short lifetime of $10^{-24}$ s, and consequently decays before it can hadronize. The top quark decays to a $W$ boson and a $b$-quark with a branching ratio of almost $100\%$, and is assumed to be such for the purpose of this analysis. The $W$ boson can subsequently decay hadronically or leptonically as shown in \autoref{fig:theory:tt_decay}, with branching ratios of approximately $68\%$ and $32\%$ respectively and with all lepton flavors having similar ratios assuming lepton universality.

\subsection{Mathematical formalism}
The \acs{SM} can be described within the formalism of quantum field theory (\acs{QFT}) with the Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{SM} = \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{QCD} + {\underbrace{(\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{gauge}+\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{fermion}+\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Higgs}+\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Yukawa})}_{\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{EW}}}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{QCD}$ is the \acs{QCD} term and $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{EW}$ is the electroweak (\acs{EW}) term of the Lagrangian.\\
QFT treats particles as excitations of their corresponding quantum fields: fermion field $\psi$, electroweak boson fields $W_{1,2,3}$ \& $B$, gluon field $G_\alpha$ and Higgs field $\phi$.\\
\acs{QFT} depends heavily on gauge theory. A quantum field has gauge symmetry if there exists a continuous gauge transformation that when applied to every point (local gauge transformation) leaves the field Lagrangian unchanged. The set of gauge transformations of a gauge symmetry is the symmetry group of the field, which comes with a set of generators, each with a corresponding gauge field. Under \acs{QFT}, the quanta of these gauge fields are called gauge bosons.
The \acs{SM} Lagrangian is gauge invariant under global Poincar\'e symmetry and local $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ gauge symmetry, with the gauge term $SU(3)_C$ corresponding to the strong interaction and $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ to the \acs{EW} interaction.\\
Global Poincar\'e symmetry ensures that $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{SM}$ satisfies translational symmetry, rotational symmetry and Lorentz boost frame invariance. By Noether's theorem, gauge symmetries lead to corresponding conservation laws which leads to conservation of momentum, angular momentum and energy in the \acs{SM}.

\subsubsection{Quantum chromodynamics}
\acs{QCD} is a non-Abelian gauge theory (Yang-Mills theory) describing the strong interaction between quarks in the \acs{SM} with the gauge group $SU(3)_C$, where $C$ represents conservation of color charge under $SU(3)_C$ symmetry.\\
According to QFT, quarks can be treated as excitations of corresponding quark fields $\psi$.
Quark fields are invariant under $SU(3)_C$ transformation
\begin{equation}
\psi \rightarrow e^{i\theta(x)T_a} \psi
\end{equation}
where $T_a$ are generators of $SU(3)_C$, represented as $T_a=\lambda_a/2$ with $\lambda_a$ being the eight Gell-Mann matrices.\\
The free Dirac Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_0=\bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu-m)\psi
\end{equation}
is invariant under global $SU(3)$ symmetry, but not under local $SU(3)_C$ symmetry.
To establish invariance under local $SU(3)_C$ symmetry, the gauge covariant derivative $D_\mu$ is defined so that
\begin{equation}
D_\mu \psi = (\partial_\mu-ig_sG^a_\mu T_a)\psi,
\end{equation}
where $g_s=\sqrt{4\pi\alpha_s}$ is the \acs{QCD} coupling constant, $G^a_\mu(x)$ are the eight gluon fields that transform under $SU(3)_C$ as
\begin{equation}
G_\mu^a \rightarrow e^{iT_a\theta_a(x)}\left( G_\mu^a+\frac{i}{g_s}\partial_\mu \right)e^{-iT_a\theta_a(x)}
=G_\mu^a - \frac{1}{g_s}\partial_\mu\theta_a(x)-f_{abc}\theta_b(x)G_\mu^c,
\end{equation} 
and $T_a$ are the generators of $SU(3)_C$ defined as $T_a=\lambda_a/2$ with $\lambda_a$ being the eight Gell-Mann matrices.\\
Defining the gluon field strength tensor $G^a_{\mu \nu}$ as
\begin{equation}
G_{\mu \nu}^a \equiv \partial_\mu G^a_\nu - \partial_\nu G^a_\mu - g_s f^{abc} G^b_\mu G^c_\nu,
\end{equation}
where $f^{abc}$ are the structure constants of $SU(3)_C$, the gauge invariant \acs{QCD} Lagrangian is
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_\text{QCD}=\bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu-m)\psi - \frac{1}{4} G_{\mu \nu}^a G_a^{\mu \nu},
\end{equation}
which can be expressed in the form of
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{QCD} = 
\underbrace{
-\frac{1}{4} G_{\mu \nu}^a G_a^{\mu \nu}
}_{\substack{\text{gluon kinematics}\\ \text{\& self-interaction}}}
+\underbrace{\vphantom{\frac{1}{4}}
\bar{\psi}\left( i\gamma^\mu \partial\mu-m \right)\psi
}_\text{quark kinematics}
+\underbrace{\vphantom{\frac{1}{4}}
\bar{\psi}^i\left( g_s \gamma^\mu (T_a)_{ij} G^a_\mu \right)\bar{\psi}^j
}_\text{quark-gluon interaction}.
\end{equation}
with $i$, $j$ being the color indices with integer values from $1$ to $3$. The noncommutativity of $SU(3)_C$ gives rise to an additional term consisting of only gluon fields and gluon-gluon interactions. Additionally, the Lagrangian also forces gluons to be massless to maintain gauge invariance.
\subsubsection{Electroweak theory}
The electroweak interaction is the unified description of the weak interaction and electromagnetism under the $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ symmetry group, where $L$ represents the left-handed chirality of the weak interaction and $Y$ represents the weak hypercharge quantum number. The quantum number associated with the weak chirality is the weak isospin $I$. The \acs{EW} quantum numbers are connected by the Gell-Mann-Nishijima relation
\begin{equation}
Q = I_3 + Y/2
\end{equation}
where $Q$ is the electric charge and $I_3$ is the third component of weak isospin $I$.\\
Fermions can have either left-handed or right-handed chirality, and can be divided into left-handed doublets and right-handed singlets
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\psi_L &= \displaystyle\binom{\nu_e}{e_L}, \displaystyle\binom{\nu_\mu}{\mu_L}, \displaystyle\binom{\nu_\tau}{\tau_L}, \displaystyle\binom{u_L}{d_L}, \displaystyle\binom{c_L}{s_L}, \displaystyle\binom{t_L}{b_L} \\
\psi_R &= e_R, \mu_R, \tau_R, u_R, d_R, c_R, s_R, t_R, b_R,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
with the exception of neutrino which can only have left-handed chirality in the \acs{SM}.\\
Both left-handed and right-handed fermion fields are invariant under $U(1)_Y$ transformation
\begin{equation}
\psi \rightarrow e^{iY\theta(x)/2} \psi.
\end{equation}
Similar to \acs{QCD}, to establish invariance under local $U(1)_Y$ symmetry, the $U(1)_Y$ gauge covariant derivative $D_\mu$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
D_\mu \phi = \left( \partial_\mu -ig' \frac{Y}{2} B_\mu \right) \psi
\end{equation}
where $B_\mu(x)$ is a vector gauge field that transforms under $U(1)_Y$ as
\begin{equation}
B_\mu \rightarrow B_\mu + \frac{1}{g'}\partial_\mu \theta(x)
\end{equation}
and $g'$ is the $B_\mu$ coupling constant.\\
%The Lagrangian
%\begin{equation}
%\mathcal{L} = \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu-m)\psi 
%= \bar{\psi}\left( i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu-m \right)\psi + \bar{\psi}\left( g\frac{Y}{2}B_\mu \right)\psi
%\end{equation}
%is then invariant under local $U(1)_Y$ symmetry.\\
Right-handed fermion singlets are not affected by $SU(2)_L$ transformation, so fermion fields transform under $SU(2)_L$ as
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\psi_L &\rightarrow e^{iI_3 \vec{\theta}(x)\cdot\vec{\sigma}/2} \psi_L \\
\psi_R &\rightarrow \psi_R.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{\sigma}/2$ are generators of $SU(2)_L$ and $\vec{\sigma}$ are Pauli matrices. In order to preserve local symmetry, the gauge covariant derivative for $SU(2)_L$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
D_\mu \psi_L = \left( \partial_\mu - ig\frac{\sigma_i}{2}W_\mu^i \right) \psi_L
\end{equation}
where $W_\mu^i (x)$ ($i=1,2,3$) are three boson gauge fields that transform under $SU(2)_L$ as
\begin{equation}
W_\mu^i \rightarrow e^{i\displaystyle\frac{\sigma_i}{2}\theta_i(x)} \left( W_\mu^i+\frac{i}{g}\partial_\mu \right) e^{-i\displaystyle\frac{\sigma_i}{2}\theta_i(x)}
= W_\mu^i + \frac{2}{g}\partial_\mu \theta_a(x) + \epsilon^{ijk}\theta_j(x) W_\mu^k,
\end{equation}
with $g$ as the gauge coupling constant for $W^i_\mu$, and $\epsilon^{ijk}$ as the structure constant for $SU(2)_L$.\\
The gauge covariant derivative for $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ can then be written as

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:EW_cov}
D_\mu \psi_L &= \left( \partial_\mu - ig'\frac{Y_L}{2}B_\mu - ig\frac{\sigma_i}{2}W_\mu^i \right) \psi_L \\
D_\mu \psi_R &= \left( \partial_\mu - ig'\frac{Y_R}{2}B_\mu \right) \psi_R.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Similar to \acs{QCD}, the kinetic term is added by defining field strengths for the four gauge fields
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
B_{\mu \nu}   &\equiv \partial_\mu B_\nu - \partial_\nu B_\mu \\
W_{\mu \nu}^i &\equiv \partial_\mu W^i_\nu - \partial_\nu W^i_\mu - g e^{ijk} W^j_\mu W^k_\nu.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The local $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ invariant \acs{EW} Lagrangian can then be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L}_\text{EW} &= i\bar{\psi}(\gamma^\mu D_\mu)\psi - \frac{1}{4}W^i_{\mu\nu}W_i^{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{4}B_{\mu\nu}B^{\mu\nu} \\
&= \underbrace{\vphantom{\left(\frac{Y}{2}\right)}
i\bar{\psi}\left(\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu\right)\psi
}_{\substack{\text{fermion}\vphantom{\frac{1}{4}}\\ \text{kinematics}}}
\underbrace{
-\bar{\psi}\left(\gamma^\mu g'\frac{Y}{2}B_\mu\right)\psi - \bar{\psi}_L\left(\gamma^\mu g\frac{\sigma_i}{2}W_\mu^i\right)\psi_L
}_\text{fermion-gauge boson interaction}
\underbrace{\vphantom{\left(\frac{Y}{2}\right)}
-\frac{1}{4}W^i_{\mu\nu}W_i^{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{4}B_{\mu\nu}B^{\mu\nu}
}_{\substack{\text{boson kinematics}\vphantom{\frac{1}{4}}\\ \text{\& self-interaction}}}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Under $\approx 159.5$ GeV, the \acs{EW} symmetry $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking into $U(1)_\text{QED}$ symmetry, which corresponds to a separation of the weak and electrodynamic forces. This replaces the massless and similarly-behaved \acs{EW} gauge bosons $B_\mu$ and $W_\mu^i$ with the \acs{EM} boson $\gamma$ and the weak bosons $Z/W^\pm$. Additionally, electroweak spontaneous symmetry breaking also gives $Z$ and $W^\pm$ masses via the Higgs mechanism, discussed in Section \ref{sec:higgs}. The 
spontaneous symmetry breaking leads to reparameterization of $B_\mu$ and $W_\mu^i$ to $W^\pm$/$Z$/$\gamma$ bosons via a specific choice of gauge for the Higgs field
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:EW_repara}
W^\pm_\mu &\equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(W^1_\mu \mp iW^2_\mu\right) \\ 
\begin{pmatrix}
A_\mu \\ Z_\mu
\end{pmatrix}
&\equiv \begin{pmatrix}
\cos \theta_\text{W} & \sin \theta_\text{W} \\
-\sin \theta_\text{W} & \cos \theta_\text{W}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
B_\mu \\ W_\mu^3
\end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\theta_\text{W}\equiv\cos^{-1}\left(g/\sqrt{g^2+g'^2}\right)$ is the weak mixing angle. The boson kinetic term can also be refactorized to extract cubic (three vertices) and quartic (four vertices) self-interactions among the gauge bosons \citep{theory:ew}. The Lagrangian can then be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:EW_L}
\mathcal{L} &=
\underbrace{\vphantom{\displaystyle\frac{e}{2\sin\theta_\text{W}}}
eA_\mu\bar{\psi}\left(\gamma^\mu Q\right)\psi
}_\text{electromagnetism}
+\underbrace{
\displaystyle\frac{e}{2\sin\theta_\text{W}\cos\theta_\text{W}}\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu\left(v_f-a_f\gamma_5 \right)\psi Z_\mu
}_\text{neutral current interaction} \\
&+\underbrace{
\displaystyle\frac{g}{2\sqrt{2}}\mathlarger{\sum}_{\psi_L}
\left[ \bar{f}_2\gamma^\mu\left(1-\gamma_5\right)f_1 W_\mu^+ + \bar{f}_1\gamma^\mu\left(1-\gamma_5\right)f_2 W_\mu^- \right]
}_\text{charged current interaction} \\
&+\mathcal{L}_\text{kinetic}+\underbrace{\vphantom{\frac{1}{4}}
\mathcal{L}_\text{cubic}+\mathcal{L}_\text{quartic}
}_\text{boson self-interaction}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_5=i\gamma^0\gamma^1\gamma^2\gamma^3$ is the chirality projection operator, $a_f=I_3$, $v_f=I_3(1-4|Q|\sin^2\theta_\text{W})$ and $f_1$, $f_2$ are up and down type fermions of a left-handed doublet.

\subsubsection{Higgs mechanism}
\label{sec:higgs}
So far, the \acs{EW} bosons are massless, since the mass terms $-m\bar{\psi}\psi$ for fermions and $-mA^\mu A_\mu$ for bosons are not invariant under the \acs{EW} Lagrangian. The particles must then acquire mass under another mechanism. The Brout-Engler-Higgs mechanism \citep{theory:higgs1,theory:higgs2,theory:brout_englert} was introduced in 1964 to rectify this issue, and verified in 2012 with the discovery of the Higgs boson \citep{theory:higgs_atlas,theory:higgs_cms}.\\
The Higgs potential is expressed as
\begin{equation}
V(\phi^\dagger\phi) = \mu^2\phi^\dagger\phi+\lambda(\phi^\dagger\phi)^2
\end{equation}
where $\mu^2$ and $\lambda>0$ are arbitrary parameters, and the $SU(2)_L$ doublet $\phi$ is the Higgs field
\begin{equation}
\phi = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\phi^+ \\ \phi^0
\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
with complex scalar fields $\phi^+$ and $\phi^0$ carrying $+1$ and $0$ electric charge respectively. The Lagrangian for a scalar field is
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_H = \left(\partial_\mu \phi\right)^\dagger \left(\partial^\mu \phi\right) - V\left(\phi^\dagger\phi\right).
\end{equation}
%which is invariant under local $U(1)$ transformation
%\begin{equation}
%\phi \rightarrow e^{i\theta(x)}\phi.
%\end{equation}
Since the potential $V(\phi^\dagger\phi)$ is constrained by $\lambda>0$, the ground state is solely controlled by $\mu$. If $\mu^2>0$, the ground state would be $\phi=0$, and the \acs{EW} bosons would remain massless. If $\mu^2<0$, the ground state would be
\begin{equation}
|\phi|^2 = -\displaystyle\frac{\mu^2}{2\lambda} \equiv \displaystyle\frac{v^2}{\sqrt{2}},
\end{equation}
where $v$ is defined as the vacuum expectation value (\acs{VEV}). The standard ground state for the Higgs potential without loss of generality can be chosen as
\begin{equation}
\phi(0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\binom{0}{v}.
\end{equation}
%ball at the top of the hat = rotational symmetry
%ball falls down and settles on a point of lowest energy = break symmetry
\textcolor{red}{sombrero potential pic}\\
Having $U(1)$ symmetry allows any $-e^{i\theta}\sqrt{\mu^2/\lambda}$ to be a ground state energy for the Higgs Lagrangian. This degeneracy results in spontaneous symmetry breaking of the $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ symmetry into $U(1)_\text{\acs{QED}}$ symmetry when the Higgs field settles on a specific vacuum state as a result of a perturbation or excitation. The spontaneous symmetry breaking introduces three massless (Nambu-Goldstone) vector gauge boson $\xi$ and a massive scalar boson $\eta$, each corresponds to a generator of the gauge group. The bosons can be extracted using the reparameterization \citep{theory:higgs_physics}
\begin{align}
\xi  &\equiv \phi^+\sqrt{2}
\  ,&
\eta &\equiv \phi^0\sqrt{2}-v,
\end{align}
such that $\xi$, $\eta$ are real fields. The Higgs field now become
\begin{equation}
\phi=\frac{v+\eta+i\xi}{\sqrt{2}}=e^{i\xi\cdot\displaystyle\frac{\sigma}{2v}}
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ \displaystyle\frac{v+\eta}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
Due to $U(1)_\text{\acs{EM}}$ invariance, a unitary gauge with the transformation $\phi \rightarrow \exp(-i\xi\cdot)\frac{\sigma}{2v}$ can be chosen to eliminate the massless bosons and incorporate them into the \acs{EM} and weak bosons through the reparameterization in \autoref{eq:EW_repara}. This leaves the massive $\eta$ which can now be observed as an excitation of the Higgs field and consequently is the Higgs boson $h$. Using the \acs{EW} covariant derivative from \autoref{eq:EW_cov}, the Higgs Lagrangian around the vacuum state becomes
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L}_H &= \left(D_\mu\phi\right)^\dagger \left(D^\mu\phi\right) - \mu^2\left(\displaystyle\frac{v+h}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2-\lambda\left(\displaystyle\frac{v+h}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^4 \\
&= \left(D_\mu\phi\right)^\dagger \left(D^\mu\phi\right) - \frac{1}{2}\mu^2h^2 - \lambda v h^3 - \frac{\lambda}{4} h^4 - \ldots.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The Higgs mass can be extracted from the quadratic term as $m_H = \sqrt{-2\mu^2}$. The kinetic term in the Lagrangian can be written as
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\left(D_\mu\phi\right)^\dagger \left(D^\mu\phi\right) 
&= \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu h)^2 + \frac{g^2}{8}(v+h)^2\left|W^1_\mu -iW^2_\mu\right|^2 + \frac{1}{8}(v+h)^2\left(g'W_\mu-gB_\mu\right) \\
&= \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu h)^2 + (v+h)^2 \left( \frac{g^2}{4}W^{+}_{\mu} W^{-\mu }+\frac{1}{8} \left(g^2+g'^2\right)Z^{0}_{\mu} Z^{0\mu} \right).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Masses for the \acs{EW} bosons can be extracted from the quadratic terms
\begin{equation}
m_{W^\pm} = \frac{v}{2}g\:, \qquad m_Z = \frac{v}{2}\sqrt{g^2+g'^2}\:, \qquad m_\gamma = 0.
\end{equation}
The fermion mass term $-m\bar{\psi}\psi$ still breaks \acs{EW} invariance after spontaneous symmetry breaking. Fermions instead acquire mass by replacing the mass term with a gauge invariant Yukawa term in the \acs{EW} Lagrangian for fermions' interactions with the Higgs field \citep{theory:higgs_physics}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L}_\text{Yukawa} 
&= -c_f\frac{v+h}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\bar{\psi}_R\psi_L+\bar{\psi}_L\psi_R\right) \\
&=
- \underbrace{\frac{c_f}{\sqrt{2}}v(\bar{\psi}\psi)}_\text{fermion mass}
- \underbrace{\frac{c_f}{\sqrt{2}}(h\bar{\psi}\psi)}_\text{fermion-Higgs interaction},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $c_f$ is the fermion-Higgs Yukawa coupling. The fermion mass is then $m_f = c_f v/\sqrt{2}$.

\section{Beyond the Standard Model}
\subsection{Top-philic vector resonance}
\label{sec:ttZp}
Many BSM models extend the \acs{SM} by adding to the \acs{SM} gauge group additional $U(1)'$ gauge symmetries, each with an associated vector gauge boson nominally named $Z'$ \citep{theory:Zp}. In the case of a \acs{BSM} global symmetry group with rank larger than the \acs{SM} gauge group, the symmetry group can break into $G_\text{\acs{SM}}\times U(1)^{'n}$, where $G_\text{\acs{SM}}$ is the \acs{SM} gauge group $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ and $U(1)^{'n}$ is any $n\geq 1$ number of $U(1)'$ symmetries. The existence of additional vector bosons $Z'$ would open up many avenues of new physics e.g. extended Higgs sectors from $U(1)'$ symmetry breaking, existence of flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) effects in some models, and possible exotic production from heavy $Z'$ decays \citep{theory:Zp}.\\
Due to the top quark having the largest mass out of all known elementary particles in the \acs{SM}, many \acs{BSM} models \citep{Ferretti:2013kya,Vecchi:2015fma,Agashe:2003zs,Agashe:2004rs} predict 'top-philic' vector resonances that have much stronger coupling to the top quark compared to other quarks such that the coupling factors to lighter quarks are negligible.\\
The analysis in this thesis attempts to reconstruct a top-philic $Z'$ resonance directly to avoid dependency on model choice. Previous model-independent \acs{BSM} \tttt search \citep{theory:ttZp} in the single-lepton final state and similar mass ranges showed no significant excess with upper limits on observed (expected) $Z'$ production cross section between 21 (14) fb to 119 (86) fb depending on parameter choice.

% exclusion limit: production xsec * branching ratio @ 95% confidence level
In addition, a simplified color-singlet vector particle model \citep{theory:ttZp,theory:ttZp_LHC} is employed to study model-dependent interpretations. The interaction Lagrangian assumes only coupling with the top quark and has the form
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L}_{Z'} &= \bar{t}\gamma_\mu\left(c_L P_L + c_R P_R\right) tZ'^{\mu}\\
&= c_t \bar{t}\gamma_\mu\left(\cos\theta P_L + \sin\theta P_R\right) tZ'^{\mu},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $c_t=\sqrt{c_L^2+c_R^2}$ is the top coupling strength, $P_{L/R}=(1\mp \gamma_5)/2$ are the chirality projection operators, and $\theta = \tan^{-1}(c_R/c_L)$ is the chirality mixing angle \citep{theory:ttZp}. Expanding the Lagrangian results in
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{Z'} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\bar{t}\gamma_\mu\left[
\sin\left(\theta+\frac{\pi}{4}\right) - \left(\sqrt{2}\cos\left(\theta+\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\right)\gamma_5
\right] tZ'^{\mu},
\end{equation}
which bears striking resemblance to the \acs{EW} Lagrangian neutral current interaction term in \autoref{eq:EW_L}, showing the similarity between the $Z'$ and the neutral $Z$ boson which acquires mass as a result of $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ spontaneous symmetry breaking.\\
Assuming the $Z'$ mass $m_{Z'}$ is much larger than the top mass ($m_t^2/m_{Z'}^2 \approx 0$), the $Z'$ decay width at leading-order (\acs{LO}) can be approximated as
\begin{equation}
\Gamma(Z' \rightarrow \ttbar) \approx \frac{c_t^2 m_{Z'}}{8\pi}.
\end{equation}
It can be observed that $\Gamma/m_{Z'} \approx c_t^2/8\pi \ll 1$ for $c_t\approx 1$. This suggests a very narrow and well-defined resonance peak, which validates the narrow-width approximation for choice of $c_t=1$ and supports efforts to directly reconstruct the resonance.\\
The main production channels for the aforementioned heavy top-philic color singlet $Z'$ are at tree level and loop level, with the one-loop level being the dominant processes. Loop level processes are dependent on the chirality angle $\theta$, where $\theta=\pi/4$ suppresses all but gluon-initiated box subprocesses \citep{theory:ttZp}. To minimize model dependence, only the tree level production was considered and consequently $\theta=\pi/4$ was chosen for this analysis. The Feynman diagrams for tree level production channels are shown in \autoref{fig:theory:ttZp_feynman}.

\end{figure}

The single-top associated final states $tjZ'$ and $tWZ'$ productions are suppressed by three-body phase space, resulting in smaller cross sections, by a factor of two, compared to the top pair associated final state process $\ttZp\rightarrow\tttt$. Unlike $tjZ'$ and $tWZ'$ which are produced by \acs{EW} and mixed \acs{QCD}-\acs{EW} interactions respectively, \tttt production is governed by the strong interaction only which can overpower phase space suppression.\\
Additionally, unlike \tttt production which is independent of $\theta$, single-top associated processes are minimally suppressed under pure left-handed interaction ($\theta=0$) and maximally suppressed under pure right-handed interaction ($\theta=\pi/2$).

\subsection{\acs{BSM} four-top quark production}
\label{sec:4top}
The analysis presented in this thesis uses the \tttt final state signal signature to search for the existence of a heavy \acs{BSM} resonance that couples strongly to the top quark.
Cross section for \tttt production can be enhanced by many possible \acs{BSM} models, in particular possible production of a heavy neutral resonance boson $X$, decaying to a \ttbar pair, in association with a \ttbar pair in composite Higgs scenarios \textcolor{red}{(citations)} or two-Higgs-doublet-model (\acs{2HDM}).\\
The \ttX production mode and consequently \tttt signal signature can provide a more sensitive channel for searches by avoiding contamination from the large $gg\rightarrow \ttbar$ \acs{SM} background in an inclusive $X\rightarrow\ttbar$ search.
\subsection*{Decay modes}
The different $W$ boson decay modes shown in \autoref{fig:theory:tt_decay} result in many different final states for \ttX/\tttt decay, which can each be classified into one of three channels: all hadronic decays; exactly one lepton or two opposite-sign leptons (\acs{1LOS}); exactly two same-sign leptons or three or more leptons (\acs{SSML}). The branching ratio for each channel is shown in \autoref{fig:theory:tttt_channels}.\\
The all hadronic and \acs{1LOS} channels have much larger branching ratios compared to \acs{SSML} channel but suffer heavily from irreducible $gg\rightarrow\ttbar$ background contamination, giving \acs{SSML} channel better sensitivity at the cost of lower statistics. This is also the targeted channel for the analysis in this thesis.
