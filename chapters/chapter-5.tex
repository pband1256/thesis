\begin{itemize}
	\item Start with computational challenge: model dependence from previous chapter
	\item Mention astrophysics applications as increased number of calculations required. Branch off into first problem: can we get one set of yields across the $r$ process region, even w/out uncertainties?
	\item NN paper says: more or less, yea
	\item Reduced order models time!
\end{itemize}
